# Weather_Prediction
In this project, different ML models were used in an attempt to predict weather. The best model was determined using accuracy score. Furthermore, to avoid overfitting of our training data, our models were pruned to determine optimal hyperparameter.

Conclusion
With exception to prunning, KNeighborsClassifier appears to be the best ML algorithm for predicting weather using the current data set, although other models such as Random Forest Classifier(RFC) and Decision Tree Classifier showed significant improvent with our training data and test data after prunning. Random Forest Classifier(RFC) performed better than other model after prunning.
